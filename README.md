# Task-2
Phishing Email Analysis

Objective:
Identify phishing indicators in a suspicious email to understand how threat actors use social engineering and spoofing techniques.

Steps Taken:
Collected a phishing email sample claiming to be from PayPal.
Analyzed the senderâ€™s email address for signs of spoofing or typosquatting.
Used XHeader Analyzer to inspect SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, as well as message routing.
Evaluated embedded links and email content for urgency, threats, and authenticity.
Summarized key phishing traits and how the email attempts to deceive the recipient.
Tools Used:

XHeader Email Header Analyzer
(Used to examine email authentication protocols and server origin.)

What I Learned:
How to detect spoofed or typosquatted domains (e.g., paypa1.com vs paypal.com).
How to interpret email headers using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC analysis.
How to recognize social engineering tactics like urgency, fear, and impersonation.
The importance of checking for personalization, branding, and link legitimacy.
How phishing emails often mimic trusted brands with slight variations and fake login pages.
